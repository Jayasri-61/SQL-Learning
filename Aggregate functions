Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into SQL Aggregate Functions to analyze and summarize data effectively.

select count(*) as no_of_records from jayasri.kavi
select sum(age) as sum_age from jayasri.kavi
select avg(age) as average_age from jayasri.kavi
select min(age) as min_age from jayasri.kavi
select max(age) as max_age from jayasri.kavi

1. COUNT()
Counts the total number of records in the table.
Useful for determining the size of datasets.

2. SUM()
Calculates the sum of values in a numeric column.
Helpful in adding up numerical data like age or salary.

3. AVG()
Returns the average value of a numeric column.
Ideal for finding the mean value in a dataset.

4. MIN()
Retrieves the minimum value from a column.
Useful for identifying the smallest value in a dataset.

5. MAX()
Retrieves the maximum value from a column.
Helps in identifying the highest value in a dataset.

Successfully practiced these aggregate functions on the jayasri.kavi table to strengthen my understanding of SQL queries.
Excited to apply these functions in real-world projects for better data insights!
