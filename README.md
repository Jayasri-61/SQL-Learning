I’ve been actively learning SQL to strengthen my understanding of database management and data analysis. Throughout this journey, I have explored various aspects of SQL, including creating and managing databases, inserting and updating records, and retrieving data efficiently. I’ve practiced applying conditions to filter data and modified table structures dynamically to meet different requirements. Additionally, I’ve worked with aggregate functions like counting records, calculating sums and averages, and identifying minimum and maximum values from datasets. I also learned to enforce data integrity by applying constraints that ensure consistency and accuracy within the database. This learning process has been enriching, and I’m excited to dive deeper into advanced SQL concepts like joins, subqueries, and stored procedures to further enhance my skills. Looking forward to applying this knowledge in real-world projects and continuing my growth in the field of database management!
