Iâ€™ve been actively exploring SQL to enhance my database management skills. Hereâ€™s a glimpse of what Iâ€™ve learned so far and how Iâ€™m progressing.
Iâ€™m making consistent progress by practicing various SQL operations and understanding core concepts.
I plan to dive deeper into advanced SQL features like joins, stored procedures, and indexing soon!

create database jayasri;
create table jayasri.girl ( 
name varchar(345),
age int,
phonenumber int,
day varchar(255)
);
insert into jayasri.girl(name, age, phonenumber, day) values("jaya", 18, 1234567890, "mon");
insert into jayasri.girl(name, age, phonenumber, day) values("reshu", 19, 1234567890, "tue");														
insert into jayasri.girl(name, age, phonenumber, day) values("madhu", 20, 1234567890, "wed");                                                         
insert into jayasri.girl(name, age, phonenumber, day) values("buvi", 21, 1234567890, "thu");                                                          																																						
select *from jayasri.girl;
select name,age, from jayasri.girl;
select *from jayasri.girl where day = "thu";
alter table jayasri.girl add mark int;
alter table jayasri.girl modify column age int not null;
alter table jayasri.girl rename column day to month;
alter table jayasri.girl rename to jayasri.kavi;
select *from jayasri.kavi;
update jayasri.kavi set name = "buva" where name = "buvi";
delete from jayasri.kavi  where age = 18;
delete from jayasri.kavi;
drop table jayasri.kavi;


1. Database and Table Creation
Created a database named jayasri.

Created a table girl with columns: name, age, phonenumber, and day.

2. Data Insertion
Inserted sample records into the girl table with names, ages, phone numbers, and days.

3. Data Retrieval
Retrieved all records from the girl table.

Displayed specific columns (name and age).

Filtered records where day equals "thu".

4. Table Modifications
Added a new column mark.

Modified the age column to NOT NULL.

Renamed the column day to month.

Renamed the table girl to kavi.

5. Data Update and Deletion
Updated the name buvi to buva.

Deleted a record where age was 18.

Deleted all records from the kavi table.

6. Table Deletion
Dropped the kavi table.
Excited to explore more advanced SQL techniques.
